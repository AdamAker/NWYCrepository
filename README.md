# NWYCrepository
My code for NWYC

The two files "news-sites.csv" and "news-sites2.csv" are both inputs of this program to be loaded into arrays A1 and A2. A2 should 
eventually be formed from a database of some sort. The code as of now only prints out the result of unstored rss feeds to the console.

Presumeably, the output should be stored to another file which would then overwrite the previous file in the database.
